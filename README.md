# [Genetic Algorithms 101](https://genetic-algorithms-101.streamlit.app/)
A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) webapp where people can learn and try out genetic algorithms!

### About
The aim of this project is to help people to get a little bit familiar with machine learning by showing them how genetic alorithms work. Genetic algorithms, when implemented, are usually hard coded. This results in a hardship when trying to interactively teach such algorithms on a high leven to begginers.<br><br>This project takes an OOP approach by creating a barebones model and its building blocks (strategies) that can be used interchangeably. This allows the model to be hosted on Streamlit, where the user can select different strategies for population initialization, selection, crossover, mutation and replacement, so they can better understand the underlying principles of genetic algorithms and how different strategies can impact outcome. All this without any need to code, which often times can be very intimidating for inexperienced programmers.

### How can I contribute?
It's very simple! All you need to do is to follow the guidelines I am going to list next. The general guidlines for contributing to projects are:
- Fork this repo
- Create a new branch
- Make your contribution
- Open a new issue and send a pull request

Here are some specific guidelines for this project:
- Every issue title must be preceeded by either one of these topics: [BUG FIX], [FEATURE], [DOCUMENTATION], [TYPOS], [CONTENT], [OTHER]
  - [BUG FIX] is self explanatory. Whenever your contribution is fixing a bug, flag it as such.
  - [FEATURE] is self explanatory too. Whenever your contribution is implementing a new feature you should mark it as such.
  - [DOCUMENTATION] if your contribution is documenting code. Specifically functions, classes and methods.
  - [TYPOS] if you find a typo somewhere in the content, documentation or even plain code.
  - [CONTENT] if you decide to add some informative content to the web app such as explaining a strategy, what genetic algorithms are. Or even if you decide to change some already written explaination. Of course, you should justify any change.
  - [OTHER] if your contribution does not belong to any of the other categories.

- Here are some code style examples:
  - write_variable_attribute_and_parameter_names_like_this
  - WRITE_CONSTANT_NAMES_LIKE_THIS
  - writeFunctionAndMethodNamesLikeThis
  - WriteClassNamesLikeThis
  - _write_private_attribute_names_like_this
  - _writePrivateMethodNamesLikeThis
- Whenever you write code, either a bug fix or a contribution, try to reduce coupling as much as possible and try not to change any more already written code than necessary. Be mindful of others work.
